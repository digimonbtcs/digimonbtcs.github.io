-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://digimonbtcs.github.io/tags/top-of-wallpaper/>Top of Wallpaper</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://digimonbtcs.github.io/posts/learning-scratch-programming/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Learning Scratch Programming ~ 5.
